Hey everyone, I'm Azlan, and welcome to my first blog! Consider this a bit of a test run, but I thought it would be a good opportunity to share *why* I'm starting this journey.

### The "Why" Behind It All

Over the past few years, I've become fascinated with deployment, networking, and self-hosting. I've explored countless tools, and consistently, the thing that made everything click was… blogs!  There was *always* a blog post, tutorial, or resource that helped me set something up or understand a complex concept.

I'm not claiming to be a writing expert, but I've recently spent a lot of time wrestling with technologies and tools.  I want to share what I've learned, even if it's just for my future self. So, here I am!

### Why Self-Hosting?

I know there are plenty of popular blogging platforms like LinkedIn, dev.to, and Medium, which offer built-in audiences and even potential for earning. But, honestly, one thing I've always disliked while reading other blogs is running into paywalls or intrusive pop-ups.

I'm a strong believer in open-source and the idea that knowledge shouldn't be locked behind a paywall.  We should support creators, absolutely, but access shouldn't be a hard barrier – more of a voluntary contribution.

Plus, I value control. The web is an open space, and I prefer to own my content and infrastructure.  I recently came across [this blog post](https://dev.to/martinsonuoha/how-to-build-a-personal-blog-2gg) where a developer's blog was temporarily blocked by Medium due to a minor policy violation. That really solidified my decision.

That's why I opted for a self-hosted solution.


### Why Hugo?

Let's be real, I'm a bit lazy! Since blogging wasn't my passion project, but something I *wanted* to do, I wanted to minimize friction. I was initially planning to use Ghost, a popular open-source blogging platform you can self-host. But then I stumbled upon a YouTube video by [Network Chuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnE7c0ELEH8&pp=ygUhbmV0d29yayBjaHVjayBob3cgdG8gYnVpbGQgYSBibG9n) explaining why he started blogging in 2024, and he was using Hugo with .md files in Obsidian.

The idea of exploring a new tool immediately appealed to me.  Writing in Markdown and tracking everything with Git just felt like the most efficient and flexible workflow. So, that's what I went with.

If you're interested in replicating my setup, you can clone or fork this [Github Repo](https://github.com/azlanmalik/blog).  All the details are in the README, so you should be up and running in no time.
